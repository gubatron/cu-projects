Many probabilities
- create fuc with true false outcomes? 
- since will do rand many times, just make a function and call it for a given percentage. 
        (look at instructions for percentage)

- random numbers in a range
use this to travel from milesA to milesB
int min = 35;
int max = 57;
    
int r = rand()%(max-min+1) + min;
