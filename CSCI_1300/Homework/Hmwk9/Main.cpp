IN CLASS QUESTIONS:
Keeping track of probabilities: main or class?
    - probs don't change
    - ie. misfortunes -- probability of having one is not in the class.
    - ie. hunting animals - animals have things in common -- have animal class... each with name, probability, how much food, bullets...
    - but probability of encoutering a misforutne or having a raider attack, have a funciton in the main; constant

Milestones
- reasons to create a class
    - similar characteristics
- 2 types of milestones
- Inheritance - base class that has everything a class has but

- name, km, depth (+ / -)
- forts don't have a toll

Map function?
- would be nice to show ppl what you're trying to do

Store
- Supplies
    - food
    - money
    - ...
    // get
    // setFood()
- Store (separate shopping activity from ppl)
    - how many of food, oxen, ... , you bought
    // printMenu
    // printBill
    // getTotalFood -- goes to setFood() ^^^
- Game (main)
    - Store myStore
    - Supplies mySupplies
    // initialize functions
    // visitStore
* how do we make sure these two classes communicate with eachother?
    - update setFood()
