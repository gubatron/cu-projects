	                     WELCOME TO OUTBACK TRAIL

				   
	G'day mate! How ya goin'?         
	
	In this gander you'll travel 'round Straya in a van with your best mate.
	Starting in Albany, Western Australia, you'll head North and explore a
	big loop around the country.

	Stop at servos for fuel and supplies.
	Take photos along the way to make money and keep your health up by
	resting every now and then. Watch out for nasty cops, or as how we like 
	to call 'em, pigs.

	Follow the instructions below and be on your way. Drive safe!
