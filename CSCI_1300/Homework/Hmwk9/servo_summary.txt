    
	You've saved $1000 AUD to spend for the trip. You will need to spend    
	the rest of your money on food, fuel, spare vehicle parts, photos, and  
	a medical kit.					

	Here is a rundown of what each item does:	
		- Food: The more you have, the less chance there is of getting sick       	   
		- Fuel: Keeps your van running (duh!)									  
		- Engine/Battery/Bumper/Tire: Keep a spare in case of a misfortune
		- Photos: Stop to take photos and sell them for money!					  
		- Meical Kit: Good health booster before you cark-it
