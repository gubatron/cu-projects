Used format from the Trivedi's code but I am having trouble implementing the function.
I realize now that I do not have a thorough understanding of the pointers and I do not now how
to make the connections to the appropriate variables. The question is simple and I understand
what is asks but I don't know  how to execute it. I have spent the two hours on this one problem and
my code does not compile.

My biggest issue has been the invalid conversion from ‘Node*’ to ‘int’
I don't know how to plug in a data integer value into the search function without running into this issue.
