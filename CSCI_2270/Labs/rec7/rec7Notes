Traversal of a Tree

    Tree Data Structure
        - hierarchial
        - Binary tree, each node can have max 2 branches
        - general tree, can have as may ranches as it wants

    Array & Linked List
        - Linear
        - have head pointer and move temp pointer linearly to access every value



Preoder Traversal
    - first traverse the root
    - then ALL nodes in left sub tree
    - then ALL nodes in right tree
    - if within left sub tree there is another sub tree
        keep traversing the left until there is no more and go right
        as you go up to make it to the root so you can start
        looking at the right sub tree
